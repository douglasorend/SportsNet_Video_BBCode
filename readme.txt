[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This modification adds a BBCodes to watch videos from the SportsNet.ca website.

The two BBCodes takes these forms:
[code]
[sportsnet]{sportsnet video URL}[/sportsnet]
[sportsnet width=x height=x]{sportsnet video URL}[/sportsnet]
[/code]
where [b]{sportsnet video URL}[/b] is the sportsnet video URL and the [b]width[/b] and [b]height[/b] parameters being optional.  If the width and height aren't specified, the video is displayed at 100% of the display post.  Please note that width and height specify the maximum size that the video may take up on the screen.

The default width and height parameters can be specified in the [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Configuration[/b] -> [b]Modification Settings[/b] area.
