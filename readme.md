## Introduction
This modification adds a BBCodes to watch videos from the SportsNet.ca website.

The two BBCodes takes these forms:
    
    [sportsnet]{sportsnet video URL}[/sportsnet]
    [sportsnet width=x height=x]{sportsnet video URL}[/sportsnet]
    
where **{sportsnet video URL}** is the sportsnet video URL and the **width** and **height** parameters being optional.  If the width and height aren't specified, the video is displayed at 100% of the display post.  Please note that width and height specify the maximum size that the video may take up on the screen.

## Admin Settings
The default width and height parameters can be specified in the **Admin** -> **Configuration** -> **Modification Settings** area.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.15, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 2, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

This mod should be installed after [Tapatalk mod](https://www.tapatalk.com/download_SimpleMachines.php), if you want to use it with Tapatalk.
